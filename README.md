# FirstPlatformerGame
My short 2D platformer game I developed while learning Unity. Involved coding player controller, adding obstacle behaviour, collectibles, adding sound design and BGM. Used Unity's tilemap system to create two levels for demonstration.

I improved on my organisational skills for this project as it required a bit more i.e. scripts, animations, sounds, sprites. Please feel free to browse the Assets folder as that's where my work is stored.
